        <h2>What is Triathalon?</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
            Triathlons first and foremost are endurance races. There are a many distances to choose from starting
            at Sprints covering 25.75km all the way up to Ironman which covers 226km. They include 3 disciplines,
            swimming, biking, and running. As an athlete, you must complete one before moving on to the next. Each
            siatance in itself is a feat for most amateure athletes. Doing all three, in a single day deserves its own recognition.

            Swimming is the first leg of any triathalon. Depending on the distance of the event, the swimming
            portion can cover from 750m for the sprint to 3.9km for a Ironman triathalom. You will typically
            see athletes dressed in wetsuites as well as other required equipment (goggles and cap). They
            will also have a timing cip around their ankles which is required to be worn during the whole race.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the swim is completed the athletes run from the water to a transition zone (T1). This is where
            they have stored their equipment for the bike portion of the event. Bikes are hung on racks with the
            equipment the athlete will use right beside their bikes, either on the ground or in a bin. What you
            will typically see in T1 is athletes tripping off their swimming equipment and replacing it with what
            they will use on the bike. Helmets and bibs (the number assigned to the athlete) are mandatory
            while other equipment is optional (i.e glasses, gloves, hydration packs, nutrition packs, ect). Once
            they have all the equipment ready to go they will run their bikes to the "mount line" whichthey MUST
            cross before hopping on their bikes and starting the bike leg of the event. This portion can be
            anywhere from 10km all the way up to 180km
        </p>

            If you were a pro in an Ironman, you can expect to be on the bike for about 6 hours! Your legs are
            cramping, you're tired, and you probably just want to go home.. But these athletes wont quit yet. There
            is still one final part to this event. The RUN! Athletes will hop off their bikes before the "dismount line"
            and run to there assigned spot in T2 (a transition zone for bike to run. Can be the same as T1 or be in
            a different place). This is where they will shed their bike equipment and replace it with what they will
            take on the run. Again, some equipment is mandatory. Some is not. Most athletes will opt for optional equipment
            as it will make the last leg of the event must easier and also safer. This part of the race can be anywhere
            from 2.5km all the way to 42km (Yes, a marathon!)
